
Todo List:
==========

1. Implement capturing errors from MuPdf at document level in java. This way errors aren't
   just pushed through the console but captured in an array so that it may be logged in a database 
   for example. This would require implementing a more sophisticated error handler at the 
   document level. Much of the JNI code has already been changed to do so.
   
2. Implement more printing features similar to Adobe.

3. Add Adobe style print dialog box.

4. Implement pdf repair feature and write to new file afterwards.

5. Extract embedded fonts and images.

6. Expand tile implementation. Use tiling when rendering to reduce memory footprint while
   creating higher resolution images. Tiling is already implemented in printing so no more
   out of memory errors. 

7. Document.clean() needs further work. This method is experimental and should not be used in production.  
   
8. Extract embedded pdfs.
